# Naive Bayes Classifer

    I know this is stupid. I've already implemented Naive-Bayes-Classifier in Typescript. But things forced me to code it in python as well. Hoping that I can keep up through this process.

    I'm literally going to copy and paste the typescript code and try to convert it to python
